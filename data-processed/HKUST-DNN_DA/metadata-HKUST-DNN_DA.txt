team_model_designation: primary

model_targets: 1-4 wk ahead inc case
target_loc: 16 german states
data_inputs: RKI (deaths and cases)
this_model_is_an_ensemble: true
this_model_is_unconditional: true

methods: Based on observations of deaths and cases since the outbreak, we have trained deep neural networks to forecast state-level weekly incident cases in Germany. Training processes are enhanced by specially designed data augmentation on the observed data.
