We here provide slightly re-formatted data on vaccination coverage in Germany.

The data sets are based on xslx files provided by Robert Koch Institute on a daily basis [here](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Daten/Impfquoten-Tab.html). Daily snapshots of these data, allowing for the construction of time series, have been collected by the [ARD Data Team](https://github.com/ard-data/2020-rki-impf-archive). Our csv file is a slightly processed version of the ones provided in their repository.

The original data were provided with labelling in German. We did our best to translate them in a meaningful way to allow for easier use by our non-German-speaking participants, but recommend to consider the original data or ARD Data repository for the German versions in case anything is unclear.
